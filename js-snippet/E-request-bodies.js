// can be structured in a variety of ways, depending on the specific API and the type of data being sent. These are three common types:
// 1.	Raw. 
                //This can technically hold any kind of string,
                //but generally includes XML or JSON, e.g. 
                //{"firstName":"Pied","lastName":"Piper"}
// 2.	x-www-form-urlencoded. 
                //This is used for sending simple text 
                // values in a query string, e.g. key1=value1&key2=value2. 
                //     All characters are url encoded, 
                //     e.g. spaces are replaced by %20.
// 3.	Binary. 
                //This is used for attaching images, videos,
                //audio, and other non-text files.
