// In Angular, the CommonModule is a fundamental module that exports a collection
//     of commonly used directives and pipes. These directives and pipes are 
//         essential for building the structure and functionality of your 
//             Angular application's templates.

// Key Functionalities:

// Directives: These are markers in your templates that instruct Angular how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) based on certain conditions or data. Some prominent directives exported by CommonModule include:
// NgIf: Conditionally includes or removes a template section based on a Boolean expression.
// NgFor: Iterates over a collection of data and displays a template for each item.
// NgClass: Dynamically adds and removes CSS classes from an element based on an expression.
// Pipes: Pipes are functions that transform data values for display in your templates. CommonModule exports several useful pipes, such as:
// DatePipe: Formats date and time values according to a specified format.
// CurrencyPipe: Formats numbers as currency values.
// DecimalPipe: Formats numbers with a specific number of decimal places.
