// By architecture
// •	RESTful APIsT: JSON formatter "Representational State Transfer" 
//     architectural principles. 
//         They use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) 
//         for interacting with resources
// •	GraphQL APIs: These use a query language to specify exactly what data you want, leading to more efficient and flexible data retrieval.
// •	SOAP APIs: These use XML protocols for sending and receiving data, and they were more common in the past but are less popular now.
// •	RPC APIs: These focus on remote procedure calls, where an application sends a request to a server and expects a specific response back.


// 2. By access:
// •	Public APIs: These are open to anyone to use, often with documentation and developer tools available.
// •	Private APIs: These are only accessible to authorized users within a specific organization or application.
// •	Partner APIs: These are used for business-to-business communication, typically between two organizations working together.
// 3. By purpose:
// •	Web APIs: These are designed for interaction between web applications and backend services.
// •	Mobile APIs: These are used to build mobile applications and access device functionalities.
// •	Payment APIs: These facilitate secure online payments and integrate with payment gateways.
// •	Social media APIs: These allow access to data and functionalities of social media platforms.
// 4. By implementation:
// •	RESTful Web Services: These are built using traditional web technologies like HTTP and JSON.
// •	Microservices APIs: These are designed for microservices architectures, where small, independent services communicate through APIs.
// •	Serverless APIs: These are hosted and managed by cloud providers, removing the need for server infrastructure on your end.
